### TicTacToe

A game played by two people, each trying to make a line of three X's or three O's in a boxlike figure with nine spaces.

In our version, we replaced 'X'/crosses with squares |_| (i am leaving the top line of the square to your imagination :wink:) to create a funnier, 
and more exciting game experience for users.
If this isn't madness, what is? :open_mouth: :open_mouth: :open_mouth:
